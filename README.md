for hvac project The goal is to design a HVAC (heating ventilation air conditioning system):
It should have
1- Heating element (a filament light bulb can be ok)
2- A cooling element (a motor with a fan attached to it is ok)
3- A temperature sensor
4- buttons to set thedesired temperature. (Keypad or use UART connected to laptop)
5- it is desirable to show the current & set temperature on LCD or seven segment.
6- The project should use FreeRTOS to concurrent tasks, real-time, and priorities. Setting the desired
temperature is lower priority than operating the fan and heat element.
